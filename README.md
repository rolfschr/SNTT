SNTT
====

Simple Number Typing Tutor helps you to learn typing numbers on a keyboard. Most typing tutors help you only to learn how to write words. I needed something to learn typing numbers correctly. There is probably nothing more simple out there. The tutor simply generates a random sequences of numbers you need to type in.

Python support is needed.
